# Integration Approaches for Seamless Feature Rollout in Legacy Dashboards

## 1. Iframe Embedding Approach

### Concept

Embed the new Aurora dashboard within the legacy environment using an iframe. To enable deep linking and smooth navigation, synchronize the URL and state between the host application and the iframe. A lightweight shared library is deployed on both sides (host and iframe) to facilitate communication, URL updates, and event handling via postMessage or similar mechanisms.

### Technical Feasibility

- Easily implementable with standard iframe capabilities.
- Synchronization of URLs via postMessage allows deep linking.
- Requires shared JavaScript library on both applications for communication.
- Compatibility depends on identical domain or CORS considerations.
- The layout of the embedded app in the iframe must support two variants:
  - One with navigation elements (menus, headers, etc.)
  - One without navigation, for a cleaner, embedded experience.

### Security Implications

- Cross-origin iframes need strict message validation.
- Potential attack vectors in message passing; should validate all messages.
- Content Security Policy (CSP) must be configured accordingly.
- Isolation of iframe minimizes risk of malicious access.

### User Experience

- Seamless in-page interaction; narratives of navigation can be maintained.
- Deep links facilitate easy sharing and bookmarking.
- Potential issues with iframe responsiveness or sandboxing.

### Challenges & Limitations

- Cross-origin restrictions and CORS policies.
- Complexity in maintaining synchronization between URLs and states.
- Limited control over iframe content if hosted externally.
- Browser compatibility considerations.

## 2. Dashboard Jumping with Session Transfer

### Concept

Enable users to transition from the legacy dashboard to the Aurora dashboard by transferring their session/authentication token. The process involves sending the token via a POST request to the Aurora app, which validates the token against Keystone (OpenStack). Once validated, the new environment establishes a session for the user, providing a seamless transition without requiring re-login.

### Technical Feasibility

- Uses existing authentication infrastructure; straightforward API calls.
- Compatible with existing auth tokens (e.g., Keystone).
- Needs secure handling of tokens and session management.

### Security Implications

- Transfer of tokens must be secured via HTTPS.
- Token validation introduces server-to-server communication.
- Risk if tokens are intercepted; must implement proper security measures.
- Session fixation and replay risks need mitigation.

### User Experience

- Quick transition with minimal user intervention.
- Preserves login states and permissions.
- Could include automatic redirection post-validation.
- Slight delay during validation may occur.
- Redirect to login page if validation fails

### Challenges & Limitations

- Reliance on token validity and Keystone API responsiveness.
- Token expiry issues or invalid tokens could disrupt flow.
- Need to synchronize sessions across legacy and new apps.
- Potential security concerns around token handling and transfer.

## Recommendations

**Best Approach:**  
The session transfer method offers a more transparent, seamless user experience with less reliance on complex cross-origin messaging and iframe communication. It leverages existing authentication infrastructure, providing a secure and straightforward transition. However, it requires tight security controls.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Develop a secure API endpoint for token validation.
- Ensure HTTPS and proper token handling practices.
- Implement redirection logic post-validation.
- Maintain session synchronization across systems.

## Objective Analysis and Recommendation

### Approach 1: Iframe Embedding

#### Pros

- **Ease of implementation:** Leveraging standard iframe techniques and postMessage API is relatively straightforward.
- **User experience:** Provides a seamless in-place UI, maintaining visual consistency.
- **Flexibility:** Supports multiple layout variations (with or without navigation).
- **Deep linking:** Can be implemented for navigation within the iframe for better user navigation and sharing.

#### Cons

- **Security complexity:** Cross-origin communication requires strict validation; any misconfiguration can pose security risks.
- **Technical limitations:** Cross-origin restrictions and CORS can complicate communication.
- **Maintenance:** Synchronization of URLs and states can become complex, especially with deep linking.
- **Performance:** Embedding multiple iframes or complex interactions may impact load times and responsiveness.

### Approach 2: Dashboard Jumping with Session Transfer

#### Pros

- **Security:** Leverages existing secure token-based authentication infrastructure (Keystone).
- **Speed:** Transition can be quick, as it involves redirecting with token validation rather than UI embedding.
- **Simplicity:** Minimal UI complexity; mainly backend validation and redirection.

#### Cons

- **Implementation complexity:** Requires secure API endpoints and robust token handling.
- **User flow:** May involve redirection delays.

### Comparative Summary: Time, Security, and Simplicity

| Criterion                  | Iframe Embedding                                                                          | Session Transfer                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time**                   | Moderate (medium complexity, cross-origin handling)                                       | Faster (mainly backend work and redirection)                                      |
| **Security**               | Moderate to high risk if not carefully validated; cross-origin communication complexities | High security if tokens are transmitted over HTTPS and validated properly         |
| **Ease of Implementation** | Moderate; requires JS libraries, URL sync mechanisms, iframe setup                        | High; standard API calls and redirection, leveraging existing auth infrastructure |
| **User Experience**        | High; seamless in-place interaction, flexible layout                                      | Low; seamless transition, minimal user interaction                                |
| **Maintenance**            | Medium to high; keeps synchronization layers                                              | Low; mainly backend validation and session management                             |

### Final Recommendation

**The session transfer approach is generally preferable** considering:

- It provides a **more secure** and **simpler** implementation, especially when already using Keystone or similar auth systems.
- It results in **faster** deployment, as it primarily involves backend validation and redirection rather than complex UI embedding.
